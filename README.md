This application allows different types of users (admins or employees), through a login module, to manage the holidays. 
For example, after login, the admins can see the pending holidays and can accept or reject them.
If the user who is logged in is an employee, he can check how many free days he has, can see all the leaves that he took or request a new one.
I developed this project using Java, Hibernate and MySQL.
